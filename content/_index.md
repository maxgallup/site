    <h2>Gallup Engineering</h2>
    <p> Hey! I'm Max Gallup, currently pursuing a Master in Computer Security at VU Amsterdam. I'm also co-running a platform that offers bachelor students a final year project in the field of autonomous driving (<a href="https://basingse.org/ase">read more</a>). On top of that, I also offer freelance software development, specializing in the fields of: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Systems Programming</li>
        <li>Integrations & Automation</li>
        <li>System Administration & Infrastructure</li>
        <li>Security Analysis</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, I have some experience with designing and building drones and offer the following engineering services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>3D Design & Printing</li>
        <li>Manufacturing & Assembly</li>
        <li>SMD Soldering</li>
        <li>Embedded Security Analysis</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p><i>Why bother with all of this? Why security?</i></p>
    <p>A more detailed answer to this question can be found in a <a href="https://basingse.org/future-of-computer-security">blog post</a> of mine. However, the short version is as follows: I believe that systems need to be built with security as a top priority from the <strong>ground up</strong> and by prioritizing requirements accordingly. It's important to align the business context with the expectations of delivering safe and secure systems to begin with, not after the fact. For this reason, I offer services exclusively in the context where high expectations towards security and quality are the norm.</p> -->
